Finds the URL for uploading pull history for Hoyoverse games.
Examples of sites that use the extracted URL are:
- [paimon.moe](https://paimon.moe/) (Genshin)
- [stardb.gg](https://stardb.gg/) (Zenless Zone Zero)

# Usage

Download the tool for your platform from [releases](https://github.com/kurorinchan/extract-wish-url/releases)

```
./extract-wish-url /path/to/genshin/install/directory
```

The install directory is the directory that contains `GenshinImpact_Data/` directory.
Or `ZenlessZoneZero_Data` for Zenless Zone Zero.

# Why use this tool

If you don't mind
1. running a powershell script
2. that was fetched remotely

Then keep using the instructions on 
[paimon.moe](https://paimon.moe/)!

If you are paranoid of running powershell scripts, try using this.

If you happen to have access to Genshin install directory on Linux or Mac,
then this tool might be helpful.
